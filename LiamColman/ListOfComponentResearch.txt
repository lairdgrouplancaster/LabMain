Wires:

-16AWG with a 1.5mm^2 cross-section
-100m reel
-Can also buy in metres, £0.59 per metre
-Different colours would be needed, so buying a metre of different colours would be the best idea
-Peak current rating of 21A, however need to take into account wire position as this would effect max current rating

Could look at using AWG 18, to reduce the initial cost, at a reduced peak current.
